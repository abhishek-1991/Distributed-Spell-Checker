### Running Serialized Version
Performance of the Hadoop version is compared with a serialized python code performing the same task. This will help in identifying the cross-over point after which Hadoop's distributed computing capabilities significantly over-power the single node execution of a python code for same task. [Code](https://github.ncsu.edu/ajain28/DIC_Project/blob/master/Testcode/spellCheck.py) and [Results](https://github.ncsu.edu/ajain28/DIC_Project/blob/master/results/outputPython.txt)
