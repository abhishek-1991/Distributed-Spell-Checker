framework Originally developed at the University of California Berkeley s AMPLab the Spark codebase was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation which has maintained it since Spark provides an interface for programming entire clusters with implicit data parallelism and fault tolerance Contents Overview Spark Core Spark SQL Spark Streaming MLlib Machine Learning Library GraphX History Hosting Spark in the cloud See also Notes References External links Overview edit Apache Spark has as its architectural foundation the resilient distributed dataset RDD a read only multiset of data items distributed over a cluster of machines that is maintained in a fault tolerant way In Spark x the RDD was the primary application programming interface API but as of Spark x use of the Dataset API is encouraged even though the RDD API is not deprecated The RDD technology still underlies the Dataset API Spark and its RDDs were developed in in response to limitations in the MapReduce cluster computing paradigm which forces a particular linear dataflow structure on distributed programs MapReduce programs read input data from disk map a function across the data reduce the results of the map and store reduction results on disk Spark s RDDs function as a working set for distributed programs that offers a deliberately restricted form of distributed shared memory Spark facilitates the implementation of both iterative algorithms that visit their data set multiple times in a loop and interactive exploratory data analysis i e the repeated database style querying of data The latency of such applications may be reduced by several orders of magnitude compared to a MapReduce implementation as was common in Apache Hadoop stacks Among the class of iterative algorithms are the training algorithms for machine learning systems which formed the initial impetus for developing Apache Spark Apache Spark requires a cluster manager and a distributed storage system For cluster management Spark supports standalone native Spark cluster Hadoop YARN or Apache Mesos For distributed storage Spark can interface with a wide variety including Hadoop Distributed File System HDFS MapR File System MapR FS Cassandra OpenStack Swift Amazon S Kudu or a custom solution can be implemented Spark also supports a pseudo distributed local mode usually used only for development or testing purposes where distributed storage is not required and the local file system can be used instead in such a scenario Spark is run on a single machine with one executor per CPU core Spark Core edit Spark Core is the foundation of the overall project It provides distributed task dispatching scheduling and basic I O functionalities exposed through an application programming interface for Java Python Scala and R centered on the RDD abstraction the Java API is available for other JVM languages but is also usable for some other non JVM languages such as Julia that can connect to the JVM This interface mirrors a functional higher order model of programming a driver program invokes parallel operations such as map filter or reduce on an RDD by passing a function to Spark which then schedules the function s execution in parallel on the cluster These operations and additional ones such as joins take RDDs as input and produce new RDDs RDDs are immutable and their operations are lazy fault tolerance is achieved by keeping track of the lineage of each RDD the sequence of operations that produced it so that it can be reconstructed in the case of data loss RDDs can contain any type of Python Java or Scala objects Besides the RDD oriented functional style of programming Spark provides two restricted forms of shared variables broadcast variables reference read only data that needs to be available on all nodes while accumulators can be used to program reductions in an imperative style A typical example of RDD centric functional programming is the following Scala program that computes the frequencies of all words occurring in a set of text files and prints the most common ones Each mw parser output monospaced font family monospace monospace map flatMap a variant of map and reduceByKey

the top words Swap word and count to sort by count Spark SQL edit Spark SQL is a component on top of Spark Core that introduced a data abstraction called DataFrames a which provides support for structured and semi structured data Spark SQL provides a domain specific language DSL to manipulate DataFrames in Scala Java or Python It also provides SQL language support with command line interfaces and ODBC JDBC server Although DataFrames lack the compile time type checking afforded by RDDs as of Spark the strongly typed DataSet is fully supported by Spark SQL as well import org

edit Spark Streaming uses Spark Core s fast scheduling capability to perform streaming analytics It ingests data in mini batches and performs RDD transformations on those mini batches of data This design enables the same set of application code written for batch analytics to be used in streaming analytics thus facilitating easy implementation of lambda architecture However this convenience comes with the penalty of latency equal to the mini batch duration Other streaming data engines that process event by event rather than in mini batches include Storm and the streaming component of Flink Spark Streaming has support built in to consume from Kafka Flume Twitter ZeroMQ Kinesis and TCP IP sockets In Spark x a separate technology based on Datasets called Structured Streaming that has a higher level interface is also provided to support streaming MLlib Machine Learning Library edit Spark MLlib is a distributed machine learning framework on top of Spark Core that due in large part to the distributed memory based Spark architecture is as much as nine times as fast as the disk based implementation used by Apache Mahout according to benchmarks done by the MLlib developers against the alternating least squares ALS implementations and before Mahout itself gained a Spark interface and scales better than Vowpal Wabbit Many common machine learning and statistical algorithms have been implemented and are shipped with MLlib which simplifies large scale machine learning pipelines including summary statistics correlations stratified sampling hypothesis testing random data generation classification and regression support vector machines logistic regression linear regression decision trees naive Bayes classification collaborative filtering techniques including alternating least squares ALS cluster analysis methods including k means and latent Dirichlet allocation LDA dimensionality reduction techniques such as singular value decomposition SVD and principal component analysis PCA feature extraction and transformation functions optimization algorithms such as stochastic gradient descent limited memory BFGS L BFGS GraphX edit GraphX is a distributed graph processing framework on top of Apache Spark Because it is based on RDDs which are immutable graphs are immutable and thus GraphX is unsuitable for graphs that need to be updated let alone in a transactional manner like a graph database GraphX provides two separate APIs for implementation of massively parallel algorithms such as PageRank a Pregel abstraction and a more general MapReduce style API Unlike its predecessor Bagel which was formally deprecated in Spark GraphX has full support for property graphs graphs where properties can be attached to edges and vertices GraphX can be viewed as being the Spark in memory version of Apache Giraph which utilized Hadoop disk based MapReduce Like Apache Spark GraphX initially started as a research project at UC Berkeley s AMPLab and Databricks and was later donated to the Apache Software Foundation and the Spark project History edit Spark was initially started by Matei Zaharia at UC Berkeley s AMPLab in and open sourced in under a BSD license In the project was donated to the Apache Software Foundation and switched its license to Apache In February Spark became a Top Level Apache Project In November Spark founder M Zaharia s company Databricks set a new world record in large scale sorting using Spark Spark had in excess of contributors in making it one of the most active projects in the Apache Software Foundation and one of the most active open source big data projects Given the popularity of the platform by paid programs like General Assembly and free fellowships like The Data Incubator have started offering
